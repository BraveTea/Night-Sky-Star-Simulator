Thinking about how to create this flickering

Make a randomiser that starts a random StarTwinkleFunction at a random interval (so a random delay must be made between functions)
I am not really sure if this works with the delays that are built into the functions. The delay() function stops the entire arduino, but perhaps 
the delays (10) are short enough to create a false sense of continuity. That or it fails misserably :)
Anyhoo, the main point is that the stars need to "randomly" twinkle.

A fake way is to use several arduinos to power the project and in that way I can easily create a sense of continuity. 
I would prefer to do it in code though.
