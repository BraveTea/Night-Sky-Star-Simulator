# Night-Sky-Star-Simulator
This repository is about creating an arduino driven twinkle ceiling for my daughter. Next to the code used to create a sense of randomness in the twinkles of the stars I will also upload schematics for the hardware. IMPORTANT This is a work in progress for me and I am using this repository to learn on the go. When it is finalised I will mention so here.
